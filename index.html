  title: Clang Clang Clang
  excerpt: The clang-clang-clang-ing you hear is not the zing of your heartstrings. It’s the sound of a trolley approaching the point on the tracks where we tied ourselves down on 9-Nov-2016.

  title: In the Navy

  title: March of Time: Changing Nothing
  excerpt: The inglorious destruction and futility of war is captured in a long forgotten book: Fragments from France by Bruce Bairnsfather. It shows the very human aspects of living life on the Western Front a century ago, and predates the much-heralded Bill Mauldin 'toons of 1941-45. Did Bruce Bairnsfather go over to Bill Mauldin's for root beer on Veteran's Day with Charles Schultz and Snoopy?

  excerpt: "'NEW!' Sirchie asserted on the cover of one of its catalogues, which served as a full-page advertisement for the 'New Fentanyl Reagent Available Now!' Sirchie described the kit as an 'industry first.' The only problem is that there is nothing new about the fentanyl kit except its name.”
