  title: Clang Clang Clang
  excerpt: The clang-clang-clang-ing you hear is not the zing of your heartstrings. It’s the sound of a trolley approaching the point on the tracks where we tied ourselves down on 9-Nov-2016.

  title: In the Navy
  excerpt: Franklin Delano Roosevelt, assistant secretary of the Navy, was once <a href="http://tinyurl.com/gwzm9nf" title="The Providence Sex Scandal of 1919"><strong>involved</strong></a> in getting American sailors to use themselves as bait for entrapping homosexual sailors (and even a priest) at the Providence, RI, YMCA. It's all juicy and hilarious and stuff. And the bait boys LOVED it.

  title: March of Time: Changing Nothing
  excerpt: The inglorious destruction and futility of war is captured in a long forgotten book: <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25951" title="Fragments From France by Bruce Bairnsfather"><strong>Fragments from France</strong></a> by Bruce Bairnsfather. It shows the very human aspects of living life on the Western Front a century ago, and predates the much-heralded Bill Mauldin 'toons of 1941-45. Did Bruce Bairnsfather go over to Bill Mauldin's for root beer on Veteran's Day with Charles Schultz and Snoopy?

  excerpt: Turns out, the CIA had many thumbs in many pies (and in many eyes) including "high culture" and literature. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/jxhy8ce" title="Hijack: The CIA and Literary Culture"><strong>And they still do.</strong></a>

  title: Greasing the Pipeline to Prison with Some Old-Ass Grease
  excerpt: "'NEW!' Sirchie asserted on the cover of one of its catalogues, which served as a full-page advertisement for the 'New Fentanyl Reagent Available Now!' Sirchie described the kit as an 'industry first.' The only problem is that <a href="http://tinyurl.com/zfzksw4" title="Street Hustle: The Truth Behind the ‘New’ Police Tool for Fighting Fentanyl"><strong>there is nothing new</strong></a> about the fentanyl kit except its name.”
